# Face-Recognition
ðŸ‘¤ Face Recognition System using Python
This project is a real-time Face Recognition System built using Python and OpenCV. It captures live video from a webcam, detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifiers, and recognizes them based on a trained model. Ideal for beginners and students working on computer vision, security systems, or attendance management projects.

ðŸ”§ Features
Real-time face detection using webcam

Face dataset creation and image preprocessing

Model training using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)

Face recognition and labeling

Easy to integrate into other systems (e.g., attendance, door lock)

ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Haar Cascades (for detection)

LBPH Face Recognizer (for recognition)

ðŸš€ How it Works
Dataset Collection â€“ Captures 30+ images per person for training.

Training â€“ Trains the model using OpenCVâ€™s LBPH recognizer.

Recognition â€“ Detects and recognizes faces in real-time with names/IDs.

ðŸ“¸ Sample Output
Green box around recognized faces with their names.

Unrecognized faces are labeled as "Unknown".

ðŸ’¡ Use Cases
Student/staff attendance

Secure login systems

Basic surveillance setups
